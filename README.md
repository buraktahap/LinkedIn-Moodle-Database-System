# LinkedIn-Moodle-Database-System

* With this project, we have created a database that implements most of the features of LinkedIn and Moodle together.
* In this system, while you are having all the features of LinkedIn and Moodle, you can share your grades via LinkedIn and you can connect your existed school on Moodle to LinkedIn.
* We've created a superclass that has all the necessary attributes. Then we've created the subclasses for specialization to use in our combined system.
